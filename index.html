        <h3>Anime</h3>
        <p>Anime is a distinctive style of animation that originated in Japan and has become popular worldwide.
            It features a wide range of genres and is known for its vibrant art, complex characters, and imaginative
          storytelling. Unlike Western animation, which is often aimed primarily at children, anime caters to audiences of all ages,
           offering everything from light-hearted comedies to deep, philosophical dramas.
            The art style often includes exaggerated facial expressions, large eyes, and intricate backgrounds.
             Anime is not just limited to television shows; it also encompasses films, web series, and even manga adaptations,
              making it a diverse and influential cultural phenomenon.</p>
